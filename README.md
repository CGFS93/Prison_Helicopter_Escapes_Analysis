# Prison Helicopter Escapes Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes instances of prison breaks where inmates escaped using helicopters. The data was obtained from the internet and analyzed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Background
The use of helicopters in prison breaks is not a new phenomenon. One of the earliest known instances of a helicopter prison escape occurred in 1971, when New York businessman Joel David Kaplan, also known as "Man Fan," escaped from Santa Martha Acatitla prison in Mexico. Kaplan eventually left Mexico and wrote a book about his experience titled "The 10-Second Jailbreak."

France has had the highest number of recorded helicopter escape attempts, with at least 11 instances. One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986 when the wife of bank robber Michel Vaujour learned how to fly a helicopter and used her skills to rescue her husband from his prison roof. Vaujour was later seriously wounded in a shootout with police, and his wife was arrested.

The record for most helicopter escapes goes to convicted murderer Pascal Payet, who used helicopters to escape from prisons in 2001, 2003, and 2007. Another multiple helicopter escapee is Vassilis Palaiokostas, who escaped for the second time from the same prison in 2009.

To prevent such escapes, many prisons have taken precautions such as installing nets or cables over open courtyards.

### Data Source
The data for this analysis was obtained from WikiPedia.

### Methodology
The analysis was performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Scope
This analysis includes instances of prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison, or a correctional facility.

## Conclusion
The use of helicopters in prison breaks is a dangerous and illegal practice. While some individuals have been successful in their attempts, many have been caught and punished. Prisons continue to take steps to prevent such escapes from occurring.
